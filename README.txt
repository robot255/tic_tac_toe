Hey Jason,

Thanks for taking the time to do this exercise.

I'm sure you played Tic-tac-toe at one point or another (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe). We're going to ask to do a two player implementation of the game using the command line for player turns. Can you please keep the following requirements in mind when working on this,

- The entry point to the game is game_runner.py. Please keep code here to a minimum and preferably no more than what you see there.
- Keep things as object-oriented as possible.
- Please maintain good test coverage.
- Feel free to add as many files and classes as you want, or change the signature of the existing methods.
- If you have the time, it would be great if you can do a single player vs AI using something like a minimax algorithm.
- Finally, feel free to spend as much time as you'd like on this but I wouldn't spend more than a day or two at the most. We'll schedule a follow-up interview for early next week to go over your solution.


You can run the test_tic_tac_toe.py file using the following command, `python test_tic_tac_toe.py`. The expected output is,

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.


Cheers,

To Do,
- Create a requirements files
- Review all of the code in detail
    - check variable names
    - properties
- Try a 4x4 game with minmax and other players
- Review test coverage for
